# Aimbot
This project is an excercise in my knowledge of computer/program memory, as well as general C# code writing.
If you would like to test/run this program, below are the steps necessary:

1. Download the Aimbot.exe release
2. Download AssaultCube from their website
3. Run AssaultCube and enter a 1 on 1 game, either with a bot or online player
4. Start Aimbot.exe and attach to the ac_client process
5. Adjust settings in the exe to your liking

If you have any further questions feel free to contact me.
If this repository is to be updated, it will be rewritten with .dll injection.
